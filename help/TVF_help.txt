TVF Help Notes:

1. String sul ponticello sound, produced using a High Pass filter. 
  Set depth around 16, set Cutoff Freq at sounding pitch, set Level3 to about 45.
  Use positive Cutoff KeyFollow values to maintain consistent tone as pitch changes.

2. Muted strings sound; use Low Pass Filter set above the sounding pitch to eliminate some of the high overtones.
