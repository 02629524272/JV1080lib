JV1080lib
=========

Linux based Manager/librarian for the Roland JV-1080.
This program will not run on Windoze - it is strictly for Linux systems.
All basic functions work correctly, see the file TODO.txt for remaining fixes.

It currently requires a MySQL database to hold the instrument definitions and other data (future enhancements will make this optional.)

Compiling the file requires that the KDE Development and ALSA development packages are installed on the system.
