JV1080lib
=========

Linux based Manager/librarian for the Roland JV-1080.
This program will not run on Windoze - it is strictly for Linux systems.
All basic functions work correctly, see the file TODO.txt for remaining fixes.

It currently requires a MySQL database to hold the instrument definitions and other data (future enhancements might make this optional.)
MySQL versions:
5.1 
5.5 

Compiled with gcc versions: 
4.5.1 
4.7.1 
4.7.2 

Compiling the file requires the following packages:
KDE Development (libkde4-devel)
ALSA development 
MySQL dev 
QT4 dev
